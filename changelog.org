* v0.2.2
  - Fix backwards reporting of cover bits
  - Allow building with GHC 8.4
  - Add an --ignore-hash argument. This is really for development (someone
    gives us a log and acov file and we want to hack on the source and re-run
    the reporter without having to hack the hash in the log every time).
* v0.2.1
  - The generated hash values should no longer depend on the library versions
    against which ACov was built.
* v0.2
  - Coverage RTL is now written to foo_coverage.sv rather than foo_coverage.v
  - SystemVerilog coverage is now based on ACOV_SV rather than ACOV_SVA
  - The input language has gained an "in" keyword. See README.md for details
  - There is now documentation in README.md
* v0.1
  - Initial release
