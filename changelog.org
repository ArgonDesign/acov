* v0.2
  - Coverage RTL is now written to foo_coverage.sv rather than foo_coverage.v
  - SystemVerilog coverage is now based on ACOV_SV rather than ACOV_SVA
  - The input language has gained a match_scopes keyword

    This can be appended to either a record statement not in a group or to a
    group. A scope whose name does not contain the associated string is just
    ignored. So 'record xxx match_scopes "foo"' means to record the value of
    xxx and expect to see every value. However, a scope that doesn't contain
    "foo" as a substring needn't see anything.
* v0.1
